# Day Schedule Planner
A simple app that helps you plan your day.

## The Assignment
This was the fifth homework assigment for UW Full Stack Bootcamp. The instructions were to make an scheduling app that would help a user plan their day and keep track of a busy schedule. The page was to display the current date and contain hours slots from 9am to 5pm. The user should be able to input and save their plans for each hour. If they were to reload the app their plans should still display in the planner. 

## The Process
The most difficult part of this assignment was getting the saved items back onto the page from local storage. It involved making a few different arrays and objects and figuring out how to access all of their values. 

I had fun designing the planner and also making save buttons that were user responsive.

## Next Steps
I would like to build on this app by making it a year planner. The user would be able to input and save plans for any day out of the entire year.
